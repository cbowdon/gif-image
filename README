What it is:
- collection of procedures to manipulate GIFs
- extract still images, metadata, recombine
- stepping stone to Obj-C code to do same

Descriptions:

<x>-test :- unit tests for <x>
images/ :- sample images for testing
bits-and-bytes :- simple conversion
gif-split :- procedures for parsing a GIF file. Currently these work as:

(gif: function-name filename args ...)

However this is only for testing purposes; the final version will hide these and expose only something like:

(define my-gif (gif filename))
(gif-metadata my-gif)
(gif-images my-gif)
